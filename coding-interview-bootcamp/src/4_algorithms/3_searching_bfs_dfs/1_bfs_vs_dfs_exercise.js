//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// BFS - because DFS will take a lot of time with this

//If the tree is very wide:
// DFS (because BFS will need to much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS - this is what it was built for

//Finding the shortest path:
// BFS
